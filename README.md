### Understanding the Interface

The tree view displays:
- **Lines**: Line range in the file
- **Code**: DXF group code number
- **Data**: Content value
- **Size**: Data size in appropriate units
- **Value Type**: Expected data type for the group code
- **Description**: Detailed group code description

### Navigation and Filtering

- Multi-tab interface for multiple files or views

#### Advanced Filtering System
- **Code Filters**:
    - Auto-complete from available codes
    - Toggle exact match and case sensitivity
    - Multiple filter tags support
    - Quick reset options

- **Data Filters**:
    - Auto-complete from available values
    - Toggle exact match and case sensitivity
    - Multiple filter tags support
    - Real-time filtering

- **Line Range Filter**:
